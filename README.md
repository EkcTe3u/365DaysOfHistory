# 365DaysOfHystory

```
Today, May 31, I decided to finish this project. 
All this time I read articles on Wikipedia and it has already become a habit. 
I will continue to read, but I want to pay more attention to other projects. 
Good luck to all! Get better and better every day

I don't really like reading books (only specialized literature),  but want to :)
So, I will read one article in wiki everyday for one year
theme - history
Let's GO
